# **Mdns-Handler**
### A super simple Mdns handler that's cross platform and handles everything for you.



## Why?
All the other handlers I saw either only allowed it to be a client or only a broadcaster. On top of that most were built on different async technologies (like tokio and async-std) which were not compatable and to me were a hassle to refactor. So I made this!  A fully sync library with the bare minimum to get a working application.

## Can I make an async version?
Go ahead, I dont care, this is simply a template for you to modify as you wish, the code is basically just here to show you how to get MDNS working for whatever your doing, change it however you want on your own fork!
